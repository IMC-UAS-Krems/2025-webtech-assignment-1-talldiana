                <h2>Training with Pai Me</h2>
                <p>Several years before the Massacre at Two Pines, Bill and Beatrix traveled to China, where he recited
                    the
                    story of a legendary martial arts master named Pai Mei, and of a deadly attack only Pai Mei knows,
                    called the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique.hortly after, the 2 reached Pai Mei's
                    residence,
                    where Pai Mei agreed to take Beatrix as his student, although she represented all the aspects he
                    hated.
                    After presumably a couple of years, Beatrix returned to the United States, and continued to serve as
                    the
                    deadliest assassin at Bill's service. </p>
                <p>Beatrix booked a one-way ticket to Okinawa, when she tracked down the legendary swordsmith Hattori
                    Hanzō,
                    who crafted Bill's sword. Upon her arrival to his sushi bar, she pretended neither to know who he
                    was
                    nor to be able to speak Japanese, yet she soon revealed to him that she needed a katana to get rid
                    of a
                    certain "vermin". The vermin was Bill, who had also been Hanzo's student. Although he took a blood
                    oath
                    to never make a sword again, Hattori was moved by her plight, and agreed to craft her one.</p>

                <h2>Facing Budd</h2>
                <p>Driving to the California desert, Beatrix locates and hides underneath Budd's trailer, waiting for
                    his
                    arrival. Upon his arrival from his job as a bouncer at a local strip bar, Beatrix storms into the
                    trailer, only to get shot in the chest with rock salt by Budd. Budd then proceeds to inject Beatrix
                    with
                    a sedative. With the help of an assistant, Budd places Beatrix inside a wooden coffin, and buries
                    her
                    alive with a flashlight in a grave that was meant for a woman named Paula Schulz.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Facing Bill</h2>
                <p>Sometime after the confrontation with Elle, Beatrix heads down to Mexico to visit Esteban Vihaio, an
                    80
                    year old pimp who was friends with Bill's mother and who Bill saw as a father figure. After a brief
                    conversation, he tells her where she can find Bill. After she arrives to his home, she discovers
                    that
                    her daughter is very much alive.</p>
                <p>After spending time with B.B., she and Bill have a long conversation in which she explains why she
                    did
                    what she did -running away and hiding when pregnant with Bill's child. After the conversation and a
                    brief sword fight, Kiddo taps Bill in the center of his chest, using a secret Five Point Palm
                    Exploding
                    Heart Technique that was taught to Kiddo by the great Kung-fu master,
                    Pai Mei.</p>
