                Hi! My name is Diana. I have been in Austria for about two months now. I am studying informatics at IMC,
                I am on my first semester.
                This is my first time creating a webpage, I hope you enjoy. It consist of five
                parts: about, contact, cv, photo gallery and a welcome page. This is a welcome page. On the right, you
                can see a photo of me taken last summer in a seaside city called Haapsalu. Although Austria is
                landlocked, at least you have mountains.
                <br>

                Ghost of Yōtei
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the snow-covered lands of northern Japan, where the mountains rise like ancient guardians and silence
                holds its breath between the trees, a warrior named Atsu walks a path carved by loss. Sixteen years ago,
                her family was torn apart by a ruthless group known as the Yōtei Six. She survived the massacre as a
                child, carrying the memory of fire and steel in her mind. From that moment, she vowed to return. Not as
                a victim, but as a blade reborn.
                <br>

                Now grown, Atsu has become an onna-musha, a warrior trained in the arts of stealth, swordsmanship, and
                survival. As her revenge unfolds, Atsu begins to uncover a deeper truth. Vengeance can consume more than
                it frees, and even the strongest warrior must choose what
                kind of ghost she wishes to become.

                <br>
                Her story isn’t only about blood or battle. It’s about the line between honor and fury, about finding
                light in a world shadowed by war. Beneath the northern stars, Atsu’s legend grows, giving us a reminder
                that even
                in the coldest places, fire can still burn bright.
